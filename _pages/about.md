I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Connecticut (UConn).

My research focuses on **concurrent bug localization**, **static analysis**, and **large language model–based software engineering**.  
I am particularly interested in developing practical and explainable techniques that bridge **bug reports** and **source code** for understanding and locating concurrency bugs in large-scale systems.
